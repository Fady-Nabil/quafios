What is Quafios?
=================
Quafios is a hobby operating system for personal computers. It is a fully
integrated operating system with its own kernel. The main purpose of the
project is to build an educational operating system to help programmers
who want to learn about operating system design and implementation.

Quafios helps programmers throughout the project documentation which
describes every bit in Quafios source code so that PC programmers not only
can understand how things go but also learn how they can implement basic
operating system designs by themselves. It also explains many topics
related to operating system development.

You can get source code and documents from the project's official
web-site. More information can be found in "Contact Us" section in this

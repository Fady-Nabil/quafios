                     ----------------------------

- Q: What is Quafios?
  A: Quafios is a simple operating system written from scratch to help
     people who want to learn about operating system design.

- Q: Is Quafios free software?
  A: Yes. Quafios is free and open-source. It is licensed under GNU GPL.

- Q: How can this project help learners?
  A: Learners can use Quafios as a case study during their learning process.
     The documentation shows how Quafios is designed, written and built. The
     source code is also very clear and readable.

- Q: Does Quafios support a GUI?
  A: Quafios is not written to be a fancy GUI OS. The target of Quafios is
     described above. Therefore, the focus is put on necessary components,
     like the kernel and API. However, it is planned to support a simple GUI
     system by next releases of Quafios.

- Q: Does Quafios use stuff from linux?
  A: No. Quafios is written from scratch. Quafios is not GNU/Linux. LIKE ANY
     OPERATING SYSTEM, Quafios has "ideas" from various systems (including
     UNIX systems, Linux, Minix, and DOS). Quafios also has its own ideas
     and rules, that's why it is not a UNIX-like system.

- Q: Man, your English is lousy!
  A: Yeah, I know... and I'm working on it. And by the way, this "Q:" is not
     a question, since it doesn't end with a question mark. But anyway, since
     I write both questions and answers... Oh boy, I am really stupid.

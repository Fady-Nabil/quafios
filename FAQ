                     ----------------------------

- Q: What is Quafios?
  A: Quafios is a hobby operating system written from scratch to help
     people who want to learn about operating system design.

  A: Yes, Quafios is free software. It is licensed under GNU GPL v3.0.

     The documentation shows how Quafios is designed, written and built. The
     source code is also very clear and readable.

  A: Yes. Quafios supports both text mode and graphics mode.

- Q: Does Quafios use stuff from GNU/Linux?
  A: No. Quafios is written from scratch. Quafios is not GNU/Linux. LIKE ANY
     OPERATING SYSTEM, Quafios has "ideas" from various systems (including
     UNIX systems, GNU/Linux, Minix, and DOS). Quafios also has its own ideas
     and rules, that's why it is not a UNIX-like system.

- Q: Man, your English is lousy!
  A: Yeah, I know... and I'm working on it. And by the way, this "Q:" is not
     a question, since it doesn't end with a question mark. But anyway, since
     I write both questions and answers... Oh boy, I am really stupid.
     Actually, I got this from the internet: whylinuxisbetter.net/faq.php.

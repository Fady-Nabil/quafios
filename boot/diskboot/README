*** Boot Quafios from MBR-partitioned disk ***

The MBR bootloader should be installed to the MBR sector of the partitioned
disk. The disk shall contain Quafios in one of its primary partitions, and
the primary partition should be set as bootable. The MBR searches for the
bootable partition and boots from it by chainloading its VBR. The VBR
loads /boot/loader.bin to memory and chainboots it.

MBR takes as input the disk number in DL. If DL = 0xFF then disk is a ramdisk
and EDI & EBP store the location of the ramdisk and image size respectively.
VBR takes the same inputs, with an extra input in DS:SI that specifies the
partition table entry.

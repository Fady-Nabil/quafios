*** Boot live Quafios from ISO medium ***

ISO medium will have ramdisk.gz in its root directory. This boot program
decompresses ramdisk.gz into memory, creating a ramdisk image. The ram disk
has its own VBR. The bootloader then chainloads that VBR, then Quafios boots
normally as if it was booted from a disk.

The ISO medium could be a CD-ROM, fixed disk, or even a ramdisk.
As an input to the program, the DL register contains disk number to boot
from. if disk number = 0xFF, the boot medium is ramdisk and EDI & EBP will
contain the memory address at which the ramdisk begins, and the size of
the ramdisk, respectively.

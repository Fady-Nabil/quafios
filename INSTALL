- Prerequirements:
====================

 - A UNIX or UNIX-like system.
 - automake.
 - gcc.
 - cdrkit.

- Compiling a live CD-ROM:
============================

1- The "configure" script shall configure quafios and create Makefiles.
   The configure script can be found in the top directory that contains
   Quafios source code files. Execute this command from your terminal:

   $ ./configure

2- Run "make" to compile Quafios source code.

   $ make

3- Create a live CD-ROM image using the compiled files:

   $ make isolive


4- Now you can burn the generated "quafios-1.0.2.iso" file in the top
   directory on a blank CD-ROM or just use an emulator (like qemu).

- Cleaning up build files:
===============================

 - To clean build files, run "make clean".
 - To clean build files and all files generated by automake
   and ./configure, run "make distclean".
